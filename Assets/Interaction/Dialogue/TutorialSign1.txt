Welcome to the Spooky Dungeon! Watch your step as you progress through the following Rooms. Press enter or left click to progress through text.
If you are reading this you have already realized how to interact with objects, pressing [space] on the keyboard.
Other than interacting to just read dialogue, Interacting can be used to pick-up and throw objects.
Try picking up the rock to the right and throwing it at the left wall to open the next room.
Progressing through this tutorial dungeon will bring you to the dungeon hub. Continue to the right to enter the second room...
