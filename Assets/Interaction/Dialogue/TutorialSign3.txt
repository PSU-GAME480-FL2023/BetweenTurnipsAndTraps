Good, now that you know about throwing objects you should learn how to attack.
In the dungeon several different types of enemies will try to hurt you. One such enemy is the Shroomber to the right.
Don't worry, we have it restrained for you to practice your attack.
Activate your left click button on your mouse to attack. Most enemies take a couple of hits.
Be careful not to get too close because it will still hurt you.
